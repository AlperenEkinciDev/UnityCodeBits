Details
============
**Scene 0 - Main Menu Scene:**<br />
The Main Menu Scene comprises of three World Space Button that direct the player to different selected scenes. The primary purpose of this scene is to demonstrate code-based fluid idle motion and its integration with interactive motion objects.<br />

**Scene 1 - Weapon Test Scene:**<br />
The Weapon Test Scene features a rotating weapon test stand with three different styles of automatically targeting weapons, an oscillating target and a World Space Button for weapon selection. The main objective of this scene is to illustrate how a highly customizable base code, combined with small behavioral variation scripts, can create significant changes.<br />

**Scene 2 - Rover Suspension Scene:**<br />
The Rover Suspension Scene is a vehicle suspension demonstration featuring a cat-operated rover named Rauver in automatic motion. The scene includes an endless randomly generated bumpy road and a camera orbit system for user interaction and ease of view. This scene aims to give an idea about how to implement a suspension system which can be integrated to various ground vehicles.<br />

**Scene 3 - Voxel Generation/Sculpt Scene:**<br />
The Voxel Generation/Sculpt Scene is a user-sculptable voxel generation scene with the same camera orbit system as the Rover Suspension Scene with an addition of Voxel Sculpting function. 2D Map Generation part of the system is inspired by [Sebastian Lague's incredible cave generation tutorial series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7yyZZjF1z4) and reporpused for 3D mesh generation. The primary purpose of this scene is to demonstrate how a large and complex system can be effectively managed and adapted to meet specific requirements by dividing it into smaller components.<br />
